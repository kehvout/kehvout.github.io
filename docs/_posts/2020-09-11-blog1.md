when i was attempting to do lab 1, i had difficulty starting it because
i tried installing it via Docker Desktop and it told me that it wasn't compatible with my version of windows since i didn't have a 
valid license. i was stumped for a bit until i realized i had to install it another way via command line on ubuntu. i haven't started
on it yet once i heard the lab was extended to next week, so i'll get to that on my other computer which has Ubuntu on a VM.
