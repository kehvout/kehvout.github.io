# **Automating the creation of a LAMP stack in Ansible**
For Lab 3, we had to automate creating a LAMP stack in Ansible, which is very similar to Lab 2, where we had to automate it via a Dockerfile. It's the same principle, just different syntax. Learning a new syntax can be a bit hard right after learning another syntax recently, but Google should be able to get you what you need. For instance, [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) has a document pages like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) for all the commands as well as their parameters. Be sure to read all of the examples in its entirety as they show how to use the commands with proper syntax. My mistake was not looking at all of the examples, so I didn't realize that I wasn't using proper syntax.

Thanks to my professor for pointing this out, this is how you change ownership of a *file*, not a *directory*. One of the steps in the lab was to give ownership and group permissions of a directory to www:data, but for some reason, despite the name saying **Change *file* ownership, group, and permissions**, I assumed it would apply to directories as well. It did not.

The correct way to change ownership of a directory is this: add the state and recurse parameters. This solved one of the issues I had with the lab.

The other issue was trying to create a symbolic link. I tried using the `shell` command but it didn't work.  I was at a loss for awhile, but apparently, that same document page had the answer to my problem.

Right under the "changing permissions" example was exactly what I needed. This solved the issue I had, though I was a little confused what goes in `src` and what goes in `dest`. It gave me an error at first when I put the parameters, but swapping them fixed it.

Aside from those issues, everything else was straightforward. Just figure out the syntax.

1. Apply the heading and install the necessary packages
2. Copy the modified dir.conf into /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
3. Clone the git affinity repository into /var/www/html/affinity
4. Change ownership and group permissions of the affinity directory to www-data
5. Create a symbolic link in the html directory and point to public directory inside the affinity directory
6. Copy 000-default.conf into /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
7. Copy apache2.conf into /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
8. Install composer
9. Start the server
