this assignment actually took me a couple tries to do because i
didn't realize we were using github pages so all i was able to 
figure out was localhost until i went and followed [this guide on
github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and now here we are. had to install some stuff like ruby and bundler to get started as well as
making a new repository on github which i had to do multiple times
because i kept messing up and wanted to start over each time.

i followed the instructions step by step once again and was able to get to this point.

another issue i came across that was due to user-error was that i kept
trying to start up the site locally when i was not in the folder that
contained all the files. i kept trying to start it up in parent
directories which resulted in my site not displaying properly and
creating unwanted _site and .jekyll-cache files. obvious fix was to
cd into the correct directory and everything was fixed.

still had fun though
