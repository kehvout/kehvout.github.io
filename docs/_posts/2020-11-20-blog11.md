## How to Add a reCAPTCHA to Your Web Server With an AWS EC2 Instance's Public IPv4 DNS 

# Prerequisites
* Launched a web server via Apache

# Getting the reCAPTCHA
1. Go to the Google reCAPTCHA admin console or click [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create).

2. **Label** the reCAPTCHA to fit your needs.

3. Choose the reCAPTCHA type. In this case, we'll be using **reCAPTCHA v2** and the **"I'm not a robot" Checkbox**.

4. Copy the public IPv4 DNS of your EC2 instance and paste it into **Domain**.

7. Send an alert to the owners if wanted.

8. Click **Submit**.

Your site has now been registered. Keep this window open for use of the site key in a bit.

# Adding the reCAPTCHA to the Web Page
1. Add the following to your code, preferably inside the `<head>`.

        <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>

2. Assuming the reCAPTCHA is being used for a `<form>`, modify your code similarly to the following, replacing `your_site_key` with the site key now in your possession.

        <form action="?" method="POST">
          <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>
          <br/>
          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>

You have successfully added a reCAPTCHA widget to your page.

# Form Being Submitted Without Verifying the reCAPTCHA
If the form is being submitting without clicking on the reCAPTCHA, you can make it a required field using the `g-recaptcha-response` that returns a value if the user has successfully verified themselves. If the value of `g-recaptcha-response` is empty, it means the user has not verified themselves yet. Using Javascript, you can prevent submission of the form if the value is empty.

    $("form").submit(function(event) {
      var recaptcha = $("#g-recaptcha-response").val();
      if (recaptcha === "") {
        event.preventDefault();
        alert("Please complete the reCAPTCHA.");
      }
    });
