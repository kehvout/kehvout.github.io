i had a few issues here and there while working on lab 1.  everything was fine up until the PHP part.  i'm not sure why, but when i was trying to install PHP Version 7.2, it would install version 7.4.  i thought it wouldn't matter too much, so i ignored it at the beginning, but that created an issue at the end of the assignment.  trying to access the page on localhost:8080 and trying to install composer gave me an error and i figured the version was the issue.  so i uninstalled 7.4 and installed 7.2 and everything worked just fine.
