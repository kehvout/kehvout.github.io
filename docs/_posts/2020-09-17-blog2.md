## How to Configure a New Machine in Oracle VM VirtualBox

# Prerequisites
This item should be installed already:
* [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
    * To view a tutorial on how to install Oracle VM VirtualBox, click [here]({% link _posts/2020-09-11-blog1.md %}).

# Configure the Machine
These steps apply to any operating system being installed.  The only difference is naming and defining the machine, as seen in step 3.
1. Open **Oracle VM VirtualBox**.

2. Click **New** at the top of the window.

3. Name the machine to anything you'd like. To make the process simpler, type the name of the operating system you will be running. For example, typing `Ubuntu 20.04` will automatically set the **Type** and **Version** parameters to `Linux` and `Ubuntu (64-bit)` respectively. You may change the **Machine Folder** location if necessary.

4. Click **Next**.

5. Set the amount of memory (RAM) in megabytes (MB) to be allocated to the machine. You may allocate the recommended memory size.

6. Select **Create a virtual hard disk now** if it isn't selected already.

7. Click **Create**.

8. Select **VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)** if it isn't selected already.

9. Click **Next**.

10. Select **Dynamically allocated** if it isn't selected already.

11. Set the size of the virtual hard disk.  You may change the file location if necessary.

12. Click **Create**.

Your machine is now ready to start.
