in my last blog post, i said that ubuntu wouldn't boot on my VM anymore for some reason, so i just started over again, redownloading an ubuntu ISO, setting it up, installing docker again, etc.  i decided to just "save the machine state" instead of "powering off the machine" so it would skip the boot process entirely, hopefully preventing that issue from happening again.

the way i approached this was by going off what was given to us, the most important ones being: a combination of columnar transposition (CT) and simple shift substitution (Caesar cipher), and the key length is less than or equal to 10 letters long.  since the algorithm used was a combination of both, i thought that, theoretically, if Caesar cipher was used before CT, i could use the deciphered text from CT in Caesar cipher to figure out the original message by brute force, assuming i had the key.

however, this had three issues.  one: i didn’t have the key or the length of the key.  two: if Caesar cipher was used after CT, it would be more tedious to figure it out manually.  three: the key length is less than or equal to 10 letters long, meaning there are 10! different possible combinations, or 3,628,800.  inputting that many permutations would also be tedious to do manually, so at that point, i was a little stumped.  as a cit major, my proficiency in coding is quite basic, so while i believe i had the right idea, other than figuring out how to code all this, the only way for me to figure this out is to find code online that does all of this automatically.

fortunately, on github, there is code that provides both Caesar cipher and CT as well as a diCTionary file.  it allows you to put a string and outputs results that seem to contain words from the diCTionary file.  given the key length, i updated the code and checked the results for each key length.

what stood out the most to me was the word “HAPPY” at key length 7.  it was the longest word i noticed after seeing a lot of other words like “IT,” “FRY,” and “BRO” at lower key lengths, all of which provided no information when skimming through the list.  with “HAPPY,” i modified the code to search for all instances at key length 7 that contained the word, and the key was revealed, along with the original message.
